## About ::

👩🏽‍🎓| Hello, I am Keyna and recently took a turn in my career to become a Fullstack Developer, The reason?, previously I managed projects focused on ICTs and innovation  and I saw how technology impacts people's lives. Being such a powerful tool, I consider that democratizing technology is everyone's task, and I am very passionate about being able to contribute to this process. 

👩🏽‍💻| I entered Henry's Fullstack Development bootcamp, and learned the main technologies used in web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, React, Redux, SQL, Sequelize, among others) creating various projects from scratch. 

🧩In addition, thanks to the experience in international business and project management, I´ve worked in multicultural and multidisciplinary environments. I have a great inclination for art in general and music in particular, I love languages, learning, finding new challenges and combining my different areas of interest to propose disruptive solutions.
